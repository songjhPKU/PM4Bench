            Existing multilingual benchmarks for Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from limitations including language-specific content biases, 
            disjointed multimodal input formats, and a lack of safety evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose <strong><span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span>, 
            the first Parallel Multilingual Multi-Modal Multi-task Benchmark for LVLMs</strong>. <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span> features a parallel corpus design across 10 languages, 
            enabling fair and accurate cross-lingual comparisons. It includes the <code>vision</code> setting where text and queries are embedded in images, 
            requiring LVLMs to simultaneously <q>see</q>, <q>read</q>, and <q>think</q>, aligning with real-world applications. 
            Additionally, <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span> incorporates safety evaluations, addressing critical oversight in existing multilingual benchmarks. 
            Using <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span>, we evaluate 11 mainstream LVLMs, revealing significant cross-linguistic performance disparities, particularly in <code>vision</code> settings,

            Comprehensive evaluation of LVLMs in multilingual scenarios is crucial for identifying shortcomings and guiding further optimization. 
            However, most existing benchmarks have certain limitations: <strong>(1) Some rely on language-specific corpora,</strong> coupling linguistic ability with cultural knowledge, 
            making it difficult to discern whether performance gaps arise from cultural knowledge deficiencies or fundamental linguistic capabilities; 
            <strong>(2) Text and images are processed separately,</strong>  unlike how humans naturally interact with multi-modal information in the real world; and 
            <strong>(3) Safety evaluation is neglected,</strong> posing risks for responsible deployment.
          </p>
          <p>To address these gaps, we propose <strong><span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span>, the first Parallel Multilingual Multi-Modal Multi-task Benchmark for LVLMs</strong>. 
            <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span> includes 10 languages and uses parallel corpora focused on world knowledge, decoupling performance from cultural contexts. 
            It includes the <code>vision</code> setting where text and queries are embedded in images, which align with real-world application scenarios such as multi-modal agents, 
            free-form web interaction, and perception and self-learning of embodied AI robots. Additionally, <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span> evaluates LVLM safety in multilingual and multi-modal contexts, 
            filling a critical gap. Detailed comparison between <span class="gradient-text">PM<sup>4</sup>Bench</span> and other benchmarks are listed in <a href="#benchmark-comparison"> Benchmark Comparison </a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-4">Design Principles</span></h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Our core motivation is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LVLMs in both usefulness and safety within multilingual &amp; 
            multi-modal scenarios. We aim to align more closely with real-world user applications, and assess LVLMs' cross-lingual performance disparities faithfully 
            and systematically. Furthermore, we aim to accurately analyze and identify the underlying issues and shortcomings of current LVLMs, providing clear guidance 
            for model optimization.
          </p>
          
          <p>To achieve this, we propose the following design principles:</p>
          
          <ul class="design-principles">
            <li><strong>Targeted Language Selection:</strong> The selected languages should cover diverse language families, varying different writing scripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Corpus:</strong> The content across languages must be semantically identical. This ensures that language-specific and culturally related knowledge is decoupled from the evaluation tasks, allowing us to remain focused on assessing fundamental language capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong><code>Vision</code> Setting:</strong> To simulate real-world applications and human perception, text and queries are "printed" onto images in <code>vision</code> setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Task Diversity:</strong> The benchmark should encompass a wide range of tasks, including perception, knowledge recall and reasoning, generation, and safety.</li>

            <div class="content has-text-justified">
              <p>
              MDUR aims to evaluate LVLM's multi-modal understanding, knowledge application and reasoning capability. 
              Thus, we chose <a href="https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io/">MMMU-pro</a> as our data source. MMMU-pro is a comprehensive dataset created to assess multi-modal models on college-level tasks 
              that demand specialized knowledge and critical reasoning. MMMU-pro has 1730 samples, each of which is an English multi-choice question with only one correct option.
              </p>
              <p>
              We translate the text of original English questions into the 9 other languages and generated the vision form images. 
              It is important to note that some of the inserted images in the MDUR task contain English characters, inherited from the original MMMU-pro samples.
               We believe that their presence has minimal impact on our <strong>"parallel"</strong> design principle.
              </p>
              <p>
              Finally, we obtain the MDUR dataset covering 10 languages, with 1730 questions for each language. 
              With MDUR task, we are able to extensively evaluate LVLM's capability to handle complicated knowledge understanding, 
              reasoning, and application under multilingual senarios. Examples of MDUR samples can be found below (Left is <code>traditional</code> and right is <code>vision</code> setting).

              MIQA focuses on open-end question answering capabilities in multi-image input scenarios. We used <a href="https://liuziyu77.github.io/MMDU/">MMDU</a>, 
              a multi-turn & multi-image dialog understanding benchmark containing 1.6K+ rounds of QA as our source of data. 
              We sampled 109 QA pairs from MMDU, where we prioritized choosing questions that included more image inputs. 
              These questions and corresponding reference answers are then translated into the 9 languages. 
              Similar to MDUR task, we also provide both <code>traditional</code> and <code>vision</code> input setting for MIQA task.

              <p>
                It's worth nothing that all the questions and answers in the MIQA dataset are sourced from Wikipedia, which encompasses a wide 
                range of general and specialized knowledge. Consequently, this necessitates that LVLM possesses not only strong visual perception 
                and reasoning skills but also a comprehensive and robust knowledge base. Meanwhile, multi-image input also puts a challenge to model's 
                ability to acquire, compare, and analyze information across images. MIQA adopts LLM as judge to score the open-ended answers of the LVLM from multiple dimensions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We expect MIQA task to extensively evaluate LVLM's perception, understanding, knowledge application, and generation capabilities under multi-image &
                multilingual inputs. Examples of MIQA samples can be found below (Left is <code>traditional</code> and right is <code>vision</code> setting).

                This task aims to evaluate LVLM's ability in recognizing words and characters of various languages. 
                We built MSOCR dataset from scratch by randomly select a series of word entries (together with their parallel corpus) from Wikipedia, 
                and then plot the words on a plain white canvas to form the vision input. Each image contains 20 lines of words in a specific language, 
                and these words, when combined, have no actual meanings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The font size of each line decreases from 40 to 2 from top to bottom. The LVLM is required to recognize all the text in the image from top to bottom. 
                We then identify the line at which the model first makes a recognition error, thereby evaluating the lower limit of font size that the model can effectively recognize.

              <p>
                We constructed the 10 sets of images, each corresponding to one of the 10 languages, with each set containing 100 images. 
                For each image, the text in its different language versions are semantically identical. This guarantees a fair comparison across linguistic contexts. 
                In this way, we aim to provide a simple yet efficient method for assessing LVLMs' OCR performance across different languages.

            In order to ensure the quality of our data, we adopt the LLM and human-expert in loop translation pipeline to acquire the parallel corpus for MDUR, MIQA and MMJB task. 
            As shown in <a href="#translation_process">translation_process</a>, the pipeline consists of 3 stages: LLM translation, manual correction, and selection.

            We first utilized <code>GPT-4o-2024-08-06</code>, which is not the model being evaluated in this paper, to translate the original English 
            corpus into the target languages. Next, we provided both the original English corpus and the translated results to two native speaker annotators, 
            who are also proficient in English. They worked independently and refined the machine-translated results based on their expertise. 
            This process yielded 3 versions of the translations: the original machine translation and the two refined versions. 
            Finally, we submitted the original English text along with the 3 translation versions to <code>Claude-3.5-sonnet</code> to select the optimal translation. 
            As a result, for the MIQA task, <strong>51%</strong> of the selected translations were refined by human experts. For the MDUR and MMJB tasks, this proportion exceeded <strong>99%</strong>.

            When constructing <code>vision</code> setting samples, we maintained consistent layout and style across 10 language versions, with differences only in text content. 
            This ensures that variations in cross-lingual evaluation results are primarily due to the model's language proficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the MDUR task, we integrate the question, options, and inserted images into a single webpage using an HTML template (adapted from MMMU-pro's open-sourced version) 
            and save the screenshot. To increase complexity, we randomly varied text styles, such as font size, weight, style, underline and shadow.
            For the MIQA task, we use a plain white canvas with a fixed width of 1280 pixels. Text is wrapped, and inserted images are resized and plotted using the PIL library.
            For the MMJB task, before plotting, we wrap text lines to 15 characters for ko, zh and 25 characters for other languages. 
            For the MSOCR task, we use a 1280*720 pixel plain white canvas, which is the commonly-used screen resolution.

          <p>For each task, each LVLM, we compute the average score <code>S<sub>avg.</sub></code> and the coefficient of variation <code>S<sub>cv.</sub></code> 
            across scores of 10 languages. <code>S<sub>cv.</sub></code> reflects the performance variability of LVLMs across different languages, and it is calculated as:
          <code>S<sub>cv.</sub> = (σ / μ) × 100%</code>,
          where <code>σ</code> is the standard deviation, and <code>μ</code> is the average of scores across the 10 languages.</p>

            As shown in <a href="#overall-table">table</a>, <code>Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp</code> dominates both settings on MDUR and MIQA tasks, and <code>QVQ-72B</code> reaches

            overall performance of recent reasoning models. This validates the effectiveness of reasoning architecture in multilingual and multi-modal scenarios. 
            Further investigation shows that in certain scenarios, LVLM demonstrates notable performance disparities across different languages, 
            as indicated by the <code>S<sub>cv.</sub></code> in <a href="#overall-table">table</a>, where the higher value reflects greater cross-lingual disparity.

                  It is clear that for most models, the usefulness decreases under the <code>vision</code> setting, while the safety increases. The decrease of model's usefulness may be due to model's limited ability to perceive textual content in images of <code>vision</code> setting, hindering model's capacity to obtain useful information in the MDUR and MIQA tasks. At the same time, this same limitation conversely enhanced the model's safety by inhibiting the extraction of harmful 
                  information in the MMJB task. Our subsequent analysis of OCR capabilities further supports this hypothesis.

                  In recent years, scaling up model size has been widely acknowledged by both academia and industry as a crucial step toward achieving AGI. 
                  We summarized the impact of model size on <a href="#modelsize_avg_cv">performance of MDUR</a>.
                <p>
                  It can be seen that in terms of overall performance (characterized by <code>S<sub>avg.</sub></code>), as the model size increases, the performance of LVLM shows an increasing trend in both <code>traditional</code> and <code>vision</code> settings. However, there is not a similarly optimistic conclusion in terms of reducing cross-language imbalance (represented by <code>S<sub>cv.</sub></code>). 
                  Although InternVL2.5-MPO, Qwen2.5-VL and GPT-4o series models all show some degree of improvement in the <code>traditional</code> setting, as the model size increases, but in the <code>vision</code> setting, the differences between languages do not noticeably improve, and even worsen in the InternVL2.5-MPO and Qwen2.5-VL series models.
                  Therefore, for the <code>vision</code> setting, we need to further explore the factors affecting cross-language differences, to better guide the efficient optimization of models.

                  The findings presented above collectively demonstrate that <code>vision</code> settings pose significant challenges for current LVLMs in multilingual contexts: 
                  <strong>(1)</strong> LVLMs exhibit marked underperformance in <code>vision</code> settings compared to <code>traditional</code> settings, 
                  <strong>(2)</strong> cross-lingual performance disparities are exacerbated in <code>vision</code> settings compared to <code>traditional</code> settings, and 
                  <strong>(3)</strong> crucially, these limitations persist despite model scaling efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the inferior performance on <code>vision</code> setting may be because of LVLM's inadequate implicit 
                OCR capabilities for multilingual text, which can not be adjusted by simply using larger models. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  To validate this hypothesis, we additionally designed <code>OCR</code> settings for MDUR, MIQA and MMJB tasks to evaluate how well does a model recognize 
                  the text content of <code>vision</code> setting images. We then compared and analyzed the relationship between the model's score of <code>OCR</code> setting and 
                  <code>vision</code> settings of these 3 tasks. Preliminary visualization results are shown in <a href="#MDUR_regression">MDUR_regression</a>.
                  Furthermore, we calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCCs). 
                  The statistics reveal that for the MDUR, MIQA, and MMJB tasks, the proportion of models with PCCs having an absolute value exceeding 0.5 
                  (indicating a strong correlation) is <strong>90.91%, 72.73%, and 72.73%</strong> of all 11 models, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The above results demonstrate high correlation between task performance and its OCR accuracy, indicating that OCR capability is a key factor 
                  influencing model's performance in <code>vision</code> settings. For MDUR and MIQA, better OCR results leads to better VQA accuracy and quality.
                   For the MMJB task, superior OCR performance enables the model to more accurately recognize and interpret harmful instructions,
                  which in turn increases the risk of model jail-breaking.

                  In this section, we aim to analyze the characteristics of reasoning models in multilingual and multi-modal scenarios. 
                  Notably, <code>Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking</code> does not provide details of its reasoning process, so our case study is limited to <code>QVQ-72B</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As shown in <a href="#overall-table">Overall score table</a>, in the MDUR and MIQA tasks, <code>Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking</code> achieved the highest average scores in both <code>vision</code> and <code>traditional</code> settings. <code>QVQ-72B</code> ranked second in both settings of MDUR and second and third in the <code>vision</code> and <code>traditional</code> settings of MIQA, respectively. Both models also exhibited low \cv values. This indicates that reasoning models excel in knowledge recall, knowledge reasoning, and multi-image comprehension, with relatively balanced multilingual capabilities. The case study of <code>QVQ-72B</code> revealed that its reasoning process involves a deep understanding of questions and logical deduction of answers, which likely contributes to its higher accuracy. Additionally, both models occasionally used English for reasoning in non-English tasks, which may partially mitigate cross-lingual performance disparities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In MMJB task, <code>Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking</code> did not perform well, while <code>QVQ-72B</code> outperformed all models in the <code>traditional</code> setting for zh, achieving a safety rate of 98.2. The case study revealed that when <code>QVQ-72B</code> refused to answer, it often did so without providing a reasoning process. This suggests that the model's safety performance primarily depends on its alignment efforts, and the influence of the reasoning chain remains unclear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for MSOCR task, <code>Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking</code>-exp ranked first in this task, while <code>QVQ-72B</code> also performed well. However, our case study revealed that although <code>QVQ-72B</code> engaged in extensive reasoning before giving OCR results, its reasoning did not involve correcting OCR results but rather reminders about its own tasks. Therefore, we believe that the strong performance of the models cannot be simply attributed to their reasoning capabilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  To summary, we found that for tasks involving knowledge application, knowledge reasoning, and analyzing logical relationships within input content, the reasoning process of reasoning models significantly enhances their performance. However, for OCR or safety related tasks, it remains uncertain whether the reasoning process of reasoning models directly contributes to task performance.
